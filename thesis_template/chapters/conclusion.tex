\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chap:conclusion}

The work on this thesis is based on the performance evaluation of Automatic machine learning libraries, the two libraries chosen for the evaluation is Autosklearn and tpot together with the development of a web interface which aids in the visual analysis for the evaluation. The theme of Automatic machine learning was chosen due to its algorithm optimization techniques and automatic methods for finding solutions to the problems. A series of experiments were conducted using 20 datasets from open source libraries, the performance criteria being the balanced-accuracy, f1 score for classification and rmse for regression tasks both the libraries took 40 hours togther for the  execution of the experiments
