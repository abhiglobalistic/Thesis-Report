\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chap:conclusion}

The work on this thesis is based on the performance evaluation of Automatic machine learning libraries, the two libraries chosen for the evaluation is Autosklearn and tpot together with the development of a web interface which aids in the visual analysis for the evaluation. The theme of Automatic machine learning was chosen due to its algorithm optimization techniques and automatic methods for finding solutions to the problems. A series of experiments were conducted using 20 datasets from open source libraries, the performance criteria being the balanced-accuracy, f1 score for classification and rmse for regression tasks both the libraries took 40 hours together for the  execution of the experiments, from the performance score comparison there is a very thin margin of 
difference between the libraries, overall with the small margin of difference Autosklearn performed better at regression tasks and tpot performed better at classification tasks.

The second objective of this thesis was to develop a web interface for evaluation of the experiments. Dash framework was utilized to build the interface, the whole interface is simple and easy to use with a single point of action which is selecting a dataset and rest all the data will be generated according to the selection. Its an one page application designed specifically to have more focus at one particular task rather than navigating to different areas, there is only one single input which the interface takes in and fetches all the data on demand.
